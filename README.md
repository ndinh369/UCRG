# UCRG
UNSW's Competitive Robotics Group contributions across two projects: Summer Research Forum and the Internals Competition.

Summer Research Forum:
- Computer vision for apple detection and counting in images using OpenCV and C++ (in fruit_det.cpp)
- ROS robot obstacle detection using LiDAR (in obs_det.cpp) and robot movement through controller (in ctrl_move.cpp)

Internals Competition:
- Computer vision for detection and localisation of dates, mandarins and pool of water using OpenCV and Python (in colour_det.ipynb)
